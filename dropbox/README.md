# Mathnasium File Viewer

Local website used to browse files.

## Getting Started

Because this is for local use only, a batch file must be ran to read the specified directory. It will also open the site automatically.
Replace 'A:/Github/mathnasium/test' with directory needed, replace 'test' directory in batch file, and remove example nav button(s).

## Built With

ViewerJS, Ryan Seddon's CSS Tree Menu.
